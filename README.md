## 📖 Overview

`OpenQuestCapture` is a Unity-based data logging and visualization tool designed for the Meta Quest 3. It captures synchronized, high-fidelity real-world data—including headset poses, stereo passthrough images, camera intrinsics, and depth maps—organized into session-based logs.

Beyond data capture, the app features **real-time depth point cloud visualization**, allowing users to see the captured environment and verify coverage directly within the headset. This ensures high-quality data collection for downstream tasks like 3D reconstruction and SLAM.

For **data parsing, visualization, and reconstruction** into COLMAP format, refer to the companion project:
**[Meta Quest 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/samuelm2/quest-3d-reconstruction)**

This includes:

* Scripts for **loading and decoding** camera poses, intrinsics, and depth descriptors
* Conversions of **raw YUV images** and **depth maps** to usable formats (RGB, point clouds)
* Utilities for **reconstructing 3D scenes** using [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/)
* Export pipelines to prepare data for **SfM/SLAM tools** like **COLMAP**

## ✅ Features

* Records HMD and controller poses (in Unity coordinate system)
* Captures **YUV passthrough images** from **both left and right cameras**
* Logs **Camera2 API characteristics** and image format information
* Saves **depth maps** and **depth descriptors** from both cameras
* **Synchronized capture** with configurable frame rate for depth and camera images (default: 3 FPS)
* **Perfect timestamp alignment** between camera images and depth maps
* **Real-time Depth Point Cloud Visualization**:
  * Visualizes depth coverage using a particle system.
  * **Color-coded feedback**: Different colors indicate different angles at which the point was captured. White indicates head-on coverage, while vivid colors indicate grazing angles.
* Automatically organizes logs into timestamped folders on internal storage


### Quick Start Guide

2. **!!! IMPORTANT !!! Enable permissions**: **When you first launch the app, make sure to check "Enable Headset Cameras" when the permissions are asked for.**
3. **Start recording**: Launch the app and press the Menu button on the left controller to start a capture session.
4. **Stop recording**: To stop, press the left controller's Menu button again.
5. **Move the data from your Quest to your computer**: The data is stored on the Quest's internal storage. You can move it to your computer using a USB cable by connecting the Quest to your computer and using Windows File Explorer. The data is stored in the `/Quest 3/Internal Shared Storage/data/com.samusynth.OpenQuestCapture/files` directory.
Or, you can use press the Y button on the left controller to toggle the Recording Menu. Select "Export Data" to export the data to a zip file in the Quest 3 Download folder which can be uploaded to Google Drive or other cloud storage services.
6. **Reconstruct the scene**: Use the companion project [Meta Quest 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/samuelm2/quest-3d-reconstruction) to reconstruct a COLMAP sparse point cloud from the captured data. Or, if you prefer a cloud-based, end-to-end solution, you can go to [vid2scene.com/upload/quest](https://vid2scene.com/upload/quest) and upload the Quest raw data zip file to create a 3DGS reconstruction on the cloud.

###  How to take a good capture

To ensure the best possible 3D reconstruction results:

1.  **Lighting**: Ensure the environment is well-lit and consistent. Avoid extreme shadows or blinding lights.
2.  **Coverage**: Use the **Depth Point Cloud Visualization** to verify you have covered all surfaces.
    *   The point visualization point color is determined by the angle at which the point was captured. White indicates head-on coverage, while vivid colors different indicate grazing angles. For best capture, try to make sure the surface has points with many different colors. This indicates it has been captured from many different angles. 
    *   Note: the point cloud visualization is for reference only. In reality, scenes are reconstructed from thousands more points than what is visible in the visualization.
3.  **Movement**: Move slowly and steadily. Avoid rapid head movements which can cause motion blur.
4.  **How long**: From my testing, the best captures usually are within the 1 to 3 minute range.

## ☁️ Cloud Processing (Recommended)

For the easiest workflow, you can upload your exported `.zip` files directly to the vid2scene cloud processing service:

**[vid2scene.com/upload/quest](https://vid2scene.com/upload/quest)**

This service will automatically process your data and generate a 3D reconstruction.

---

## 💻 Local Processing & Reconstruction

If you prefer to process data locally, this project includes a submodule **[quest-3d-reconstruction](https://github.com/samuelm2/quest-3d-reconstruction)** with powerful Python scripts.

### Setup

Ensure you have the submodule initialized:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### End-to-End Pipeline

The `e2e_quest_to_colmap.py` script provides a one-step solution to convert your Quest data into a COLMAP format.

**Usage Example:**

```bash
python quest-3d-reconstruction/scripts/e2e_quest_to_colmap.py \
  --project_dir /path/to/extracted/session/folder \
  --output_dir /path/to/output/colmap/project \ 
  --use_colored_pointcloud
```

Once in colmap format, the reconstruction can be passed into various Gaussian Splatting tools to generate a Gaussian Splatting scene.

**What this script does:**
1. **Converts YUV images** to RGB.
2. **Reconstructs the 3D scene** (point cloud).
3. **Exports** everything (images, cameras, points) to a COLMAP sparse model.

## 🎨 Tone Mapping for Indoor Scenes

If you're capturing indoor scenes with windows, you may notice that bright window light can blow out the interior lighting, resulting in overexposed highlights and underexposed shadows. The reconstruction pipeline includes **tone mapping** (CLAHE + gamma correction) to fix this issue during YUV→RGB conversion.

This is **especially effective for indoor environments** where natural light from windows creates high dynamic range conditions that exceed the camera's capture capability.

### How to Enable

Edit `quest-3d-reconstruction/config/pipeline_config.yml` before running the reconstruction:

```yaml
yuv_to_rgb:
  tone_mapping: true              # Enable tone mapping
  tone_mapping_method: "clahe+gamma"  # Options: "clahe", "gamma", "clahe+gamma"
  clahe_clip_limit: 2.0           # Contrast enhancement (1.0-4.0)
  clahe_tile_grid_size: 8         # Local adaptation grid size (4-16)
  gamma_correction: 1.2           # Brightness boost (>1 brightens)
```

Then run the pipeline as normal. The tone mapping will be applied automatically when converting YUV images to RGB.

For more details and advanced options, see the full documentation in the [quest-3d-reconstruction README](https://github.com/samuelm2/quest-3d-reconstruction#-tone-mapping-for-high-dynamic-range-scenes).

One area improvment is the export process. Currently it can take several minutes to export a session. It would be great to have a faster way to do this.
